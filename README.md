# Msg Util
Voice, and text messaging utility for the Tor network. To learn about the Tor network go here https://www.torproject.org. This application includes a world map users can markup, and transmits their drawings the same as voice and text messages. Using msg_util makes it easy to send voice, text, map drawings to anyone on the Tor network. You only need to select an onion address in the connections list and click the send button of your choice. Msg_util uses push-to-talk functionality for voice messages. All voice, text, and map markups are transmitted over the Tor network via the msg_util hidden service. This application was written for Linux and was only run on Ubuntu 16 LTS.
